<p>Kellie Shanahan from North Carolina - I don’t live on a farm, but I do have some in house chickens. My home can tend to get a bit cold, so I loved dressing my chicken Henery up in the Santa outfit. So cute!!! Thank you guys again! Best brand ever!!!</p>

<p>Michael Adams from Maine: My daughter wanted a chicken for her birthday and my wife and I were a bit hesitant to buy one since we don’t have any experience with chickens. After my wife and I walked or a bit, we decided to buy her a fake chicken that looks real. We came across this website and saw all these cute outfits. Now our little girl is happy, because of you wonderful people.

<p>Lorraine McGeeney from Alabama: I am a teacher at a High School in my town. I was in collaboration with my students for a senior prank. Our plan was to bring a bunch of chickens in the hallway with outfits on them. </p>

<p>Cindy Shiffrin from Colorado: I own a little small scale farm in the town of Greeley, CO. On my farm, I have goats, chickens, and cats. Unfortunately, the cats have been going after the chickens and so every morning when I wake up, there is a dead chicken at the end of my bed. I thought of the idea of putting chicken clothing on my chickens. Ever since then, there have been no more dead chickens at the end of my bed. </p>
