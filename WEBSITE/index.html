<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
<p>Here at Chic Chickens, we strive to make chickens from all over feel great in their own wings. Our brand does not have a certain stereotype, we fit chickens with those groovy curves all the way to that styling slim figure. The ultimate goal as a brand, is for every chicken should feel comfortable and confident in our clothing.

  <p id="a"><span class="name">SAMMY - </span>I grew up in the suburbs of Kentucky. As a kid, I would help my dad run our farm. I was homeschooled, so I spent a lot of time in the fields and dirt. Tending the chickens with my dad, was my all time favorite thing to do! He treasured those chickens like they were his own children. When my father passed away, I took it as my responsibility to continue his chicken legacy, that is why I have decided to start my brand, Chic Chickens.
</p>
  <p id="b"><span class="name">ANTHONY - </span>Animals are my passion. Everyday felt like a dream waking up on the farm. I would wake up, get my chores done, and then the rest of the day was left for me to hangout with the animals. My sister Sammy would always hangout with the Chickens, and it made me mad, because I loved the chickens. Occasionally, I would lock her in the barn with the horses, so I could have my alone time with the chickens.

<h1 class="subtitle">Our Story<h1>

<div class="content" id="content2">
<div id="p">
  <p>The love that we have for animals came from our childhood. Our farm is located in Independence, Kentucky. It is a family run farm. When we were kids, we would help our parents out with the farm chores. Anthony would help our father out with gathering the hay, cleaning the stalls, and doing the dirty work. Sammy would help out our mother with cleaning the house, bathing most of the animals, and collecting the eggs from the chickens. Sammy’s favorite thing was to gather the eggs. Our parents started the farm back in 1996. Now in 2019, us siblings have taken it over. </p>
  <p> All 75 acres of land gets a little lonely. That is why we had the idea to start a business. It gives us the opportunity to travel into the city more and express our love for animals. Creating a business as siblings can be pretty challenging considering we are great at arguing. The number one thing we realized when working together is that we both specialize in our own areas. Saying that, Anthony focuses a lot on the in depth coding of the website and the feeding of the animals. Sammy works mostly on the fine tunes of the website and a lot with the design, marketing, and manufacturing of the clothing. </p>
