<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
<p>Here at Chic Chickens, we strive to make chickens from all over feel great in their own wings. Our brand does not have a certain stereotype, we fit chickens with those groovy curves all the way to that styling slim figure. The ultimate goal as a brand, is for every chicken should feel comfortable and confident in our clothing.

  <p id="a"><span class="name">SAMMY - </span>I grew up in the suburbs of Kentucky. As a kid, I would help my dad run our farm. I was homeschooled, so I spent a lot of time in the fields and dirt. Tending the chickens with my dad, was my all time favorite thing to do! He treasured those chickens like they were his own children. When my father passed away, I took it as my responsibility to continue his chicken legacy, that is why I have decided to start my brand, Chic Chickens.

  <p id="b"><span class="name">ANTHONY - </span>Animals are my passion. Everyday felt like a dream waking up on the farm. I would wake up, get my chores done, and then the rest of the day was left for me to hangout with the animals. My sister Sammy would always hangout with the Chickens, and it made me mad, because I loved the chickens. Occasionally, I would lock her in the barn with the horses, so I could have my alone time with the chickens.
